        <p class="lead mb-4"><br>My name is Bhakti Patel. I am a current 4th-year Biology major at UCR. Alongside my interests in business and healthcare, I enjoy going on hikes and watching sunsets. I took a spontaneous trip last year to the Umpqua National Park in Oregon and it was the most liberating experience Iâ€™ve ever had in nature. The chirping of the hummingbirds, the warmth of the hot springs, and the clear sky stargazing brought immense tranquility all around. Ever since I was little I have always been fascinated by nature and have been passionate about helping protect it. I would love to work for a company that values the planet Earth and partakes in actions that showcase that.
<br>

        Enter bio here<br> Last summer, I spent time assisting patients at Kaiser Permanente with primary care alongside nurses and physicians. This also included discharging wheelchair patients, handling information charts of patients, transporting blood work to the lab, and performing CPR when needed. I also obtained my CPT1 phlebotomy license and worked at a clinic in El Monte to gain blood drawing experience. The job included venipuncture and capillary puncture, taking patient vitals, and blood specimen storage. 
<br>

        Enter bio here<br> Recently Iâ€™ve been interested in the business field and have been trying to expand my experience level, while still keeping my healthcare roots. At the beginning of this year, I started working at Crest Motel in Corona, CA. It is a desk management position with managerial responsibilities. I interact with the customers, rent rooms, and manage the money flow, and accounts. I have also dipped my toes into the field of computer science. This semester Iâ€™ve been working with the AWS console. Iâ€™ve experimented with the Cloud9 service and have built e-commerce websites and online portfolios. I customized my pages with HTML and CSS and even added login features using APIs. Recently I started learning C++ and although I am still a beginner, I love the endless possibilities of creating things through code.
	I am currently in search of a job relating to healthcare consulting after graduation. It is a hybrid between the healthcare and business field which fits my interest and passion. I am willing and open to learning new skills that may be useful for this particular field. My time management skills will help me stay on track with multiple projects at once. My attention to detail will be useful while dealing with client requests. A consultant should have sound decision-making skills as itâ€™s important to come up with proper solutions when issues are time-sensitive. I am willing to take calculated risks in order to stay on top of deadlines as I know the importance of being punctual. While a consultant should be a proficient team player with the ability to collaborate, leadership capabilities are essential as well. I have gained leadership skills from my college clubs- UCRPrishi and Bhangra Dance Team. I was on board for Special Events and Vice President, where I learned how to lead and work as a group. I also learned how to deal with conflicting ideas between members and efficiently work under extreme stress. I can serve clients with my skills to lead teams of people as well as develop and implement strategic plans from start to finish.
